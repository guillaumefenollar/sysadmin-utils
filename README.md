sysadmin-utils
==============

Toolbox for Linux Sysadmins (Shell scripts)
These scripts are mostly not stored here to be downloaded and used as they are, but they can permit to reuse a piece of code I used in the past.
Of course, it will help me too to work safely from now on.
Moreover, if you are interested to make me discover some interesting way (and easier) to make an action (in replacement of another action of one of my scripts), don't hesiate to push! I'm here to learn.

Cheers dudes, I wish you a great scripting session!
